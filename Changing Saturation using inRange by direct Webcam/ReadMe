In color image processing, there are various models one of which is the hue, saturation, value (HSV) model. 
Using this model, an object with a certain color can be detected and to reduce the influence of light intensity from the outside. 

cv2.inRange(src, lowerb, upperb) 
Here, src is the input image. ‘lowerb’ and ‘upperb’ denotes the lower and upper boundary of the threshold region. 
A pixel is set to 255 if it lies within the boundaries specified otherwise set to 0. This way it returns the thresholded image.
