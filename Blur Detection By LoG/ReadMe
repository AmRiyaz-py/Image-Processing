          # BLUR DETECTION BY LAPLACIAN OF GAUSSIAN
          
          Terms Used:
          
          cv2 :- OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
          
          Numpy:- NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
                  NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. 
                  It is an open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
          
          Laplacian of Gaussian:- Unlike first-order filters that detect the edges based on local maxima or minima, Laplacian detects the edges at zero crossings 
          i.e. where the value changes from negative to positive and vice-versa.
          To reduce the noise effect, image is first smoothed with a Gaussian filter and then we find the zero crossings using Laplacian.
          This two-step process is called the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operation
          
                        To detect the blur we could use different approaches, in general all of them are related to the sharpness of the edges of an image.
                                    So we will focus in this tutorial on a specific Edge detection filter which is the Laplacian filter.
                                      And the most amazing thing is that the actual blur detection can be done with just a line of code.

                                                      laplacian_var = cv2.Laplacian(img, cv2.CV_64F).var()
                      The line above return as value the average variance of the edges in an image. The higher the number, the sharper the edge is.
